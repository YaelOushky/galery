             Rules Minesweeper rules are very simple. The board is divided 
             into cells, with mines randomly distributed. 
             To win, you need to open all the cells. The number on a cell 
             shows the number of mines adjacent to it. Using this information,
              you can determine cells that are safe, and cells that contain mines.
               Cells suspected of being mines can be marked with a flag using the
                right mouse button.`,

            available to read on the Internet. It differs from the common idea of an
            e-book, which is usually available for users to download and read locally on 
            a computer, smartphone or on an e-reader. "Book-like" means: information is presented
            in a page format; pages are normally available to read sequentially (though "flipping" to
            another page is possible using a mouse, keyboard or other controllers); and pages are read
            passively, with little or no interaction or multimedia. This contrasts with a text which a 
            user is reading on an interactive Web 2.0 website, which usually enables the user to click on 
            online links, look up words or keywords online, etc. "Online" means the content may only be read 
            while the reader is connected to the Internet. Thus the reader's experience with an online book is
            similar to reading a printed book, except that the book is read at a computer and is only accessible
            while the reader is online.`,
